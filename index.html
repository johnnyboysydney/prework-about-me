      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I’m currently, a senior Systems Engineer, going into DevOps. I have always found all IT related fascinating and I always wanted to, one day, be a “game maker”. 
The time spent at the Arcades, spending my 20 cents, leftovers from buying milk, only increased the passion that I have and that it has only grown throughout the years. After 15 years in IT, working on Systems, I have the need to move into DevOps, which requires a set of skills that I currently do not have. 
I have now, decided to get those skills and engage in a bootcamp for the next 6 months, to gain the necessary skills to be a full stack web developer. Which is just the first of many in my learning path.

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I did my frist web pages in the 90's using HTML, and Dreamweaver in the early 2000's. I haven't touched it since then, but it has always been one of my goals.</p>
